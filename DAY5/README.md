# Day 5: Structs & Methods

## Learn:
- Structs (Custom Data Types).
- Methods (Functions tied to a struct).

## Resources:
- [Structs in Go](https://gobyexample.com/structs)
- [Methods in Go](https://gobyexample.com/methods)

## Exercises:
1. **Define a `Person` struct with `name` and `age`.**
2. **Implement a method `Birthday()` that increases the personâ€™s age.**
3. **Create a struct for a `Car` with fields `Brand` and `Year`.**

## Notes:
- Structs group related data together.
- Methods allow struct-related functionality.
- Using pointer receivers (`*Person`) allows modifying struct fields.
