# Day 4: Arrays, Slices & Maps

## Learn:
- Arrays vs Slices.
- Slices (`append`, `copy`).
- Maps (Key-Value Data Structure).

## Resources:
- [Slices in Go](https://gobyexample.com/slices)
- [Maps in Go](https://gobyexample.com/maps)

## Exercises:
1. **Create an array of 5 numbers and print their sum.**
2. **Use a slice to store a list of names and add a new name.**
3. **Create a map that stores country names as keys and their capitals as values.**

## Notes:
- Arrays have fixed lengths, while slices are dynamic.
- `append()` adds elements to slices.
- Maps store key-value pairs and are useful for lookups.
