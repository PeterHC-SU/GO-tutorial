# Day 6: Pointers & Interfaces

## Learn:
- Pointers (`*` and `&`).
- Interfaces (Defining behaviors).

## Resources:
- [Pointers in Go](https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/1)
- [Interfaces in Go](https://gobyexample.com/interfaces)

## Exercises:
1. **Write a function using pointers to swap two numbers.**
2. **Create an interface `Shape` with an `Area()` method and implement it for `Circle` and `Rectangle`.**
3. **Use a pointer receiver to modify struct values inside a method.**

## Notes:
- Pointers allow modifying variables via memory addresses.
- Interfaces define behavior, making code more flexible.
- Methods with pointer receivers modify struct values.
