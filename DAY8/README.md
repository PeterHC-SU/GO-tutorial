# Day 8: File Handling & JSON Processing

## Learn:
- Read/Write files in Go.
- JSON encoding/decoding.

## Resources:
- [Reading and Writing Files](https://gobyexample.com/reading-files)
- [JSON in Go](https://gobyexample.com/json)

## Exercises:
1. **Write a program that reads a file and prints its content.**
2. **Create a Go struct and serialize it to JSON.**
3. **Read JSON data from a file and parse it.**

## Notes:
- `ioutil.WriteFile()` and `ioutil.ReadFile()` handle file I/O.
- `json.Marshal()` encodes Go structs to JSON.
- `json.Unmarshal()` decodes JSON into Go structs.
